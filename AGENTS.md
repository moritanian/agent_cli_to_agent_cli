# Repository Guidelines

This note complements the high-level context in `README.md`. For the sandbox UI specification and environment setup, start there; use this guide for contributor expectations and daily workflows.

## Project Structure & Module Organization

- `frontend/` contains the Vite + React sandbox UI and is the primary application for this repository. Components, hooks, and styles reside under `frontend/src` (see README for the feature overview).
- `backend/` houses the FastAPI service plus reusable LLM clients and CLI demos (all code lives under `backend/src`). `sandbox_simulation.py` is the authoritative engine for multi-agent state and turn resolution.
- Top-level files (`README.md`, `AGENTS.md`, `TODO.md`) document process and outstanding work; they should remain light on implementation detail.

## Build, Test, and Development Commands

Run everything from inside `backend/` or `frontend/` with `uv` and `yarn` respectively:
- Backend environment sync: `uv sync`
- FastAPI server: `uv run serve --reload`
- CLI demos: `uv run python -m two_agent_demo` (or `single_agent_demo`, `sandbox_game`, etc.)
- Backend tests: `uv run pytest`
- Frontend dev server: `yarn install` (first run) then `yarn dev`
- Frontend build check: `yarn build`

## Coding Style & Naming Conventions

Python code follows 4-space indentation, `snake_case` names, and type hints. Shared clients inherit from `CLIChatCompletionClient`; keep constructor keyword arguments (`make_argv`, `parse_response`, `extra_flags`) consistent to simplify swapping backends. Use concise docstrings at the module/class level and reserve inline comments for logic that is not self-evident.

React components live in `frontend/src`, use functional components with hooks, and keep JSX presentational logic close to domain utilities. Co-locate styles in `App.css` unless a component genuinely warrants modular CSS.

## Testing Guidelines

Unit tests run via `uv run pytest` and currently live in `backend/tests`. Prefer mocking LLM calls with `MockCliChatCompletionClient` when writing new tests. Frontend changes rely on manual verificationâ€”call out expected visual checks (board layout, conversation log scroll, debug panel behaviour) in your PR description until automated UI coverage is introduced.

## Commit & Pull Request Guidelines

Keep commits focused and descriptive (imperative tense, <75 characters). Mention the subsystem in the subject when helpful (e.g., `backend`, `frontend`). Provide a short body describing motivation + validation steps if not obvious. Do not push new commits without explicit approval from the requestor when they are actively guiding the work.
